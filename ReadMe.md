## Draw a neighbourhood of similar-but-different looking house by creating one parameterized house and then redrawing it multiple times with different parameter values

## translation: wall, chimney, window, tree, door 
### rotate: roof, window, chimney, door, tree
### scale: tree, window, wall, chimney, roof, door
### shear: tree, wall 
### reflection: roof(also scale), tree

## top-left copy: scaled 75% ,rotated 9 degrees
### wall translated left, chimney translated up 
### tree and window scaled bigger   

## top-center copy: scaled 50%, translated right by (.1, .1)
### chimney rotated 0.2 radians, tree rotated 0.3 radians 
### roof and door scaled bigger   

## top-right copy: scaled 70%, rotated -9 degrees
### roof rotated -0.2 radians, door rotated -0.3 radians 
### tree translated left down and window translated left   


## center-left copy: rotated 180 degrees, translated left up
### roof rotated 0.2 radians, window rotated -0.3 radians 
### tree translated right up and door translated left up    


## center-right copy: sheared x and y by -0.2
### tree rotated 0.3 radians, door rotated -0.3 radians 
### wall and window scaled bigger  


## bottom-left copy: translated left by -0.1, scaled 80%; 
### tree sheared x and y by -0.3 , wall sheared -0.2
### roof rotated  -0.2 radians, window rotated -0.3 radians


## bottom-center copy: translated right by 0.12, scaled 130%; 
### door translated left up and window translated down 
### roof and tree scaled half

## bottom-right copy: translated right by 0.15, scaled 80%; 
### roof reflected by x axis and scaled, tree reflected by x axis 
### chimney rotated by 180 degrees, window rotated 0.3 radians
